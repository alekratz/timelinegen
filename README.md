# Timeline Creator
This is a prototype of a timeline creator, written in Kotlin using JavaFX. This README currently does not contain any useful information; I'm mostly using it as a TODO list.

# TODO
* [ ] Tie up loose ends in the UI where input is not checked
* [ ] Add error messages for input validation
* [ ] Support removal of timeline items
* [ ] Support editing of timeline items
* [ ] Allow timeline templates to be loaded/saved as JSON
* [ ] Try to clean up the code some, get rid of some of the hackier code
* [ ] Support customizable event colors
