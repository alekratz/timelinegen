# Timeline Creator
This is a prototype of a timeline creator, written in Kotlin using JavaFX. This README currently does not contain any useful information; I'm mostly using it as a TODO list.

# TODO
* [ ] Tie up loose ends in the UI where input is not checked
* [x] Add error messages for input validation
* [ ] Support editing/removal of timeline items
* [ ] Allow timelines and templates to be loaded/saved as JSON
* [ ] Support customizable event colors
* [ ] Support different age separation; these would be akin to our CE/BCE or AD/BC aging. Multitudes of ages are quite common in fantasy settings.
* [x] Good(!) documentation of the code and what it all does
* [ ] Sharing UI values among different event templates; e.g. when moving from a "birth" template to a "death" template, the name in the input box is preserved
* [ ] Try to clean up the code some, get rid of some of the hackier code (a big cleanup will happen especially near the release)
